			<p>The reasoning behind making Wavy was to educate people on the oceans we have on our planet. People know about the oceans and that they exist but doesnâ€™t know about the really important details that drastically changed the course of human history. This includes, trade within the Indian ocean when the silk road was blocked and to the Marina trench (the deepest point known on earth). We as humans usually focus on the land we see and give attention to that part of the world, but forget the aquatic wonderland under the ocean.</br></br>Funny story that happened around January, I randomly asked one of my good friends, How many oceans are there? He told me three, this is a high school senior by the way. So after that funny encounter, I knew that I had to create a site educating people on the Oceans.</br></br>I know someone will ask, What about the Southern Ocean? I didn't add the Southern Ocean because it isn't considered an Ocean by all the countries.</br></br></p>
